Question Pattern:
* What is System calls & Signals. 
* Differents between components and servics.
* Explain the basic architecture & interfacing of OS.
From Process management the question would be like:

* Which question will process first in specific algorithm?
* How much time to wait each one in specific algorithm?
* What is the function/application of the Process?
